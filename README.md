# Updated 5-Node Topology with Serf, Containerlab, K3s, Custom Scheduler, and Controller DaemonSet

This repository provides a complete 5-node Kubernetes-based topology using Containerlab. Each node is configured with:

- Serf for decentralized cluster membership
- K3s as the lightweight Kubernetes distribution
- A custom Kubernetes scheduler
- A controller DaemonSet that exposes real-time node resource metrics

## Files Included

- `ceos5node.yaml`: Main topology file defining nodes and configuration
- `Dockerfile`: Builds the base image used by each node
- `test-pod.yaml`: Test pod manifest for verifying the custom scheduler

## Components

### Custom Scheduler

- Makes pod scheduling decisions based on actual node resource availability
- Pulls metrics from the `resource-api` container running in the controller DaemonSet
- Considers CPU usage, memory usage, PSI (Pressure Stall Information), and available cores

### Controller DaemonSet

- Runs on every node in the topology
- Continuously monitors system-level resource usage
- Outputs current resource offers to `/tmp/resource_offer.json`
- Exposes an HTTP API on port 8080 for the scheduler to query node status

### Liqo Integration

- Liqo installation is initiated through the `ceos5node.yaml` file
- Currently under development ‚Äî some issues may prevent successful installation
- Manual updates may be required to complete Liqo federation

## For deployment follow information below.

# 5 Nodes Topology with Serf & Containerlab

This project sets up a 5-node network topology using [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev), along with Serf agents for decentralized cluster membership and node communication. It's useful for experimenting with service discovery, failure detection, and distributed coordination in lab environments.
